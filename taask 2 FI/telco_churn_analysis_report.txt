ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------
• **Early Intervention Program**: Target customers in first 3 months with personalized onboarding and support
• **Contract Incentives**: Convert month-to-month to annual contracts with 10-15% discount
• **Payment Method Optimization**: Encourage electronic checks over mailed checks (27.2% lower churn)
• **At-Risk Customer Flagging**: Use tenure (<12 months) + monthly charges (>$70) as churn predictors
• **Service Bundle Optimization**: Review combinations with high churn and improve value proposition
• **Proactive Retention**: Reach out to customers showing 2+ risk factors before they churn
• **Loyalty Rewards**: Implement tenure-based rewards starting at 6 months
• **Churn Prediction Model**: Build ML model using tenure, contract, charges as key features

EXPECTED IMPACT
---------------
Implementing these recommendations could potentially:
• Reduce churn rate from 26.5% to under 20% (30%+ improvement)
• Save $41,739 monthly in recovered revenue
• Increase average customer lifetime from 32.4 to 38.8 months
